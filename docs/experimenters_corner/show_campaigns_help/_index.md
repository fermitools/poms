On the left are the experiment and campaign name, then a summary of active jobs at the
end of the time window shown, and then a summary of jobs completed in the time window
shown.

Each campaign name is a link to the campaign info page, which besides information about
the campaign, has links to perform actions related to the campaign.

Each of the job counts in the table is a link to a table showing the jobs that give that total.
