We will be running tests under "pytest"
http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html

I'm enabling all the test discovery possible, including
doctests.

The directories here are:

data        -- data for tests -- sample condor_q output, etc.
bin_mock_*  -- bin directories to fake various utilities
mock_*      -- source for service/other mock-ups

There are also several Mock*.py modules here, which are python modules
to make using the mock tools above easy.

The rest are mostly test runners.
