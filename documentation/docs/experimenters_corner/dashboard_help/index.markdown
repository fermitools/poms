This screen shows status of services, and has a ![menu1.png]({{ site.url }}/docs/images/menu1.png) menu to get elsewhere.

The status display can be clicked open to see subcomponents:

![status1.png]({{ site.url }}/docs/images/status1.png)

This shows a toplevel component whose status is Good (green) and is
composed of 2 subcomponents, zero of which are failed. And then
each of the two subcomponents are based on monitoring statistics
from the pages reachable by the link.
