POMS interfaces to the services data at [https://fifemon.fnal.gov](https://fifemon.fnal.gov) to determine if there are any issues or service downtimes based on specific criteria. If an interruption in service is detected, the data gets stored in the POMS database. This calendar represents the downtimes recorded. Related service items are grouped together and are color coded; look at the legend in the screenshots to see this. Red is the default color for items that do not belong to any particular category.

Not only is this a representation of ACTUAL service disruptions but also of SCHEDULED planned downtimes, which users can create. Simply click on a day in the calendar, and follow the prompts. The default span for a downtime is the entire day, however this can be modified by dragging and dropping the start and end times around in the day and week views. Take note that you can also move a downtime from one day to another by simply dragging and dropping the item in the month view. Users can not create their own service name for a SCHEDULED downtime, it has to be a service that POMS knows about.

Only SCHEDULED downtimes can be modified.

If you prefer, you can also click on a SCHEDULED downtime to modify its values.

The main purpose of this calendar is to help users triage their jobs.
